# Paddle_Ocr
PaddleOCR is an open-source, rich-featured OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system developed by PaddlePaddle (by Baidu). It is designed to provide ultra-accurate, fast, and production-ready OCR capabilities for multiple languages and text types.

PaddleOCR is a deep learning-based OCR system that can detect and recognize text from images, PDFs, scanned documents, videos, and other visual sources. It combines state-of-the-art models for both text detection and text recognition into a modular and easy-to-use pipeline.Built on the PaddlePaddle deep learning framework, PaddleOCR supports a wide variety of applications in document analysis, automation, smart data entry, and AI-assisted workflows.
# Features
1) Multi-language support: 80+ languages including English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hindi, French, Russian, and more.
2) High accuracy models: Uses advanced algorithms like DB (Differentiable Binarization) for detection and CRNN/Transformer-based recognition.
3) End-to-end OCR pipeline: Text detection → text recognition → post-processing.
4) Fast inference: Optimized for GPU and CPU performance.
